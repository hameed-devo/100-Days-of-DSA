# 📅 Day 1 of 100 Days of DSA

📍 **Today’s Progress:**  
Solved 4 classic problems in Java as part of my daily DSA practice! 💪  

---

### ✅ 1. Find Minimum and Maximum in an Array  
🔗 [https://lnkd.in/gTPUjeKM](https://lnkd.in/gTPUjeKM)  
🧠 *Approach:* Implemented a simple linear scan to get both min and max elements.  

---

### ✅ 2. Reverse an Array In-Place  
🔗 [https://lnkd.in/gPPKzbvv](https://lnkd.in/gPPKzbvv)  
🧠 *Approach:* Used a two-pointer swapping technique to reverse without using extra space.  

---

### ✅ 3. Maximum Subarray Sum (Kadane’s Algorithm)  
🔗 [https://lnkd.in/gtBQrMWt](https://lnkd.in/gtBQrMWt)  
🧠 *Approach:* Maintained a running sum and tracked the maximum subarray sum found so far.  

---

### ✅ 4. Check if Array Contains Duplicate  
🔗 [https://lnkd.in/gcvkZ5QN](https://lnkd.in/gcvkZ5QN)  
🧠 *Approach:* Tried a brute-force nested loop approach (will optimize next!).  

---

### 💡 Learnings
- Revised fundamental array operations and scanning logic.  
- Understood how pointer-based swapping works internally.  
- Strengthened grasp of **Kadane’s Algorithm** and problem breakdown.

Excited to continue this daily streak and track my learning progress 🚀
